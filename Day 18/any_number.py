############ Day 18: Any Number of Arguments ###########

# Write a function called "any_number" that can receive any number of arguments (integers and floats) and return the average of those integers. If you pass 12, 90, 12, 34 as arguments you function should return 37.0 as average. If you pass 12, 90 your function should return 51.0 as average.

def any_number(*nums):
    numbers = list(nums)
    sums = sum(numbers)
    length = len(numbers)

    return sums / length


print(any_number(12, 90, 12, 34))
print(any_number(12, 90))
