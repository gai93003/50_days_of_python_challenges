############## Extra Challenges: Zero Both ends ##################

# Write a function called "zeroed" code that takes a list of numbers as an argument. The code should zero (0) and the last number in the list. For example, if the input is [2, 5, 7, 8, 9], your code should return [0, 5, 7, 8, 0].

def zeroed(nums):
    nums[0], nums[-1] = 0, 0

    return nums

numbers = [2, 5, 7, 8, 9]
print(zeroed(numbers))
